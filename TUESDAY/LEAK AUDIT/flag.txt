use DB browser for SQLite tool in kali and visualize the given db file properly.

the DB gives the asnwer to the first question: 376 total records.

Second question can be answered by the following SQL query.
SELECT password FROM personal WHERE password IN (SELECT password FROM personal GROUP BY password HAVING COUNT(*) >1); : mah6geiVoo

In the end we can see passwords starting with $ sign. I suppose these are the password given by Bcrypt.
the following query answers the third question.
SELECT count(password) from personal where password like "$%"; : 21

flag: 376_mah6geiVoo_21
